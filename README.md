# Medusa: Building GPU-based Parallel Sparse Graph Applications with Sequential C/C++ Code

##Introduction##
The graphics processing unit (GPU) has been adopted to accelerate sparse graph processing algorithms such as BFS and shortest path. However, it is difﬁcult to write correct and efﬁcient GPU programs and even more difﬁcult for graph processing due to the irregularities of graph structures. To simplify graph processing on GPUs, we introduce Medusa, a programming framework which enables developers to leverage the capabilities of GPUs by writing sequential C/C++ code. Medusa focuses on sparse graph, which is more challenging than the dense graph for GPU processing, due to its more irregular computation and memory access patterns.

Medusa offers a small set of user-deﬁned APIs, and embraces a runtime system to automatically execute those APIs in parallel on the GPUs. We further develop a series of graph-centric optimizations based on the architecture features of GPU for efﬁciency. Additionally, Medusa is extended to execute on multiple GPUs within a machine or a cluster. Our empirical studies demonstrate the programmability and efﬁciency of Medusa for a series of common graph operations.

##Platform##
The current version of Medusa is implemented using the following platform.
* Programming Language - CUDA, C/C++
* Build - MS Visual Studio/gcc, CUDA nvcc

##Datasets##
We provide a set of graph files to test Medusa. These graphs are also used in our papers. The graph files are stored in the GTGraph output format.
